HuGenVarDetective
===============
HuGenVarDetective (GVD) contains code and workflow for analysing human genes using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) version 4. The goal of this project was to leverage GATK4's powerful tools for variant discovery (SNP/MNP and INDELs) to conduct comprehensive genomic analyses.
